# Rah-Rah's HTML Buy tool for Goblins

About 

Hey! You found it â€” this is my little HTML tool for the community.
Use it, play with it, tweak itâ€¦ just remember who made it ðŸ˜Ž. Hours of work (or maybe just silly Python code) went into it, but now itâ€™s more pleasant for your eyes.

Usage:


Copy whole shops inventory to a file. from the line to line. <- Seems to be quite vital
use raw view for right viewing of this shit right here, or just trust me and copy from line to line.

|  1.| An obsidian onyx                             |50000|  1|                        
|  2.| A mansion key                                |   20|  2|                        
|  3.| etc.                                         | 3,50|  1|                        
`-------------------------------------------------------------'                        

If using Zmud you dont have to remove <80% SHOW MORE> or whatever is shown if you dont roll the whole screen at once, that's taken care of.



Open the HTML file.


Follow the descriptions in the tool â€” you canâ€™t go wrong, except if you mistype the price field ^_^. It will buy 1 of anything <= that price.

Maybe make it run in your client â€” shouldnâ€™t be that hard. Now it is what it is, but please share so we can all triumph!
