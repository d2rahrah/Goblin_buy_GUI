# Rah-Rah's HTML Buy tool for Goblins

About

Hey! You found it â€” this is my little HTML tool for the community.
Use it, play with it, tweak itâ€¦ just remember who made it ðŸ˜Ž. Hours of work (or maybe just silly Python code) went into it, but now itâ€™s more pleasant for your eyes.

Usage

Open the HTML file.

Copy whole shops inventory to a file.

Follow the descriptions in the tool â€” you canâ€™t go wrong, except if you mistype the price field ^_^.

Maybe make it run in your client â€” shouldnâ€™t be that hard. Now it is what it is, but please share so we can all triumph!


*Greenskin Federation/Ferengi Alliance note: This program and its use are Ferengi property. Using it may incur a court-ruled usage fee depending on tokens consumed. Ferengi law takes precedence over human licenses on Terra, while galactic scale usage is overruled only by a civilized council.*
