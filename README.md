# Rah-Rah's HTML Buy tool for Goblins

About:
Hey! You found it â€” this is my little HTML tool for the community.  
Use it, play with it, tweak itâ€¦ just remember who made it as it's so complicated and hours hours have gone into it ðŸ˜Ž..

Maybe make it in your client, should not be that hard. Now it is what it is, but plz share and we shall triumph! Greenskin federation!

Usage:
In desc there is pretty much what you need to operate. Just open it and you cant go wrong, except broke if you typo the price field ^_^
